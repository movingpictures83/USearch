PluMA plugin that clusters reads using USearch (Edgar et al, 2010).

The plugin accepts as input a TXT file of keyword-value pairs (whitespace-delimited):
sequences: FASTA file of sequences

Clusters are then output in FASTA format

This plugin was generated by PluGen and relies on usearch being in the system PATH.
